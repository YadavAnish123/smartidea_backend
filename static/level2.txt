LEARNING LEVELS & FLOW - EDUCATIONAL MODULE DOCUMENTATION
==========================================================

MODULE: LEVEL 2 - INTERACTIVE OBJECT TAPPING
--------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
To encourage active participation and engagement by allowing children to tap on images of objects and receive immediate auditory feedback. This interactivity fosters stronger sound-object association and motivates learning through positive reinforcement.

HOW IT WORKS:

1. MULTI-OBJECT DISPLAY:
   - Several familiar object images are displayed on the screen at once (e.g., apple, ball, car, cup).
   - Each object acts as a tappable interactive element.

2. AUDIO RESPONSE ON TAP:
   - When a child taps on any image, a voice immediately announces the name of the object.
   - The audio is delivered in the selected language (English or Hindi).

3. POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT:
   - After the object's name is spoken, an encouraging phrase plays such as:
     - “Well done!” / “Good job!”
     - “Shabash!” / “बहुत अच्छा!”
   - These phrases rotate randomly to maintain novelty.

4. LANGUAGE TOGGLE:
   - A visible switch allows the user to change between English and Hindi.
   - Both object names and reinforcement phrases adapt to the selected language.

5. REPEAT OPTION (OPTIONAL):
   - A small button appears beside each object for repeating the name on demand (for accessibility and review).

KEY SKILLS TARGETED:
- Hand-eye coordination
- Sound-object association
- Bilingual vocabulary building
- Cause-effect understanding
- Interactive learning engagement

INTENDED USERS:
Children aged 2–6 years, especially in early learning, kindergarten, or preschool settings. Designed to support both independent exploration and guided instruction.

USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN:
- Bright, intuitive UI with large tappable areas
- Minimal clutter to avoid confusion
- Audio feedback within 0.5 seconds of interaction
- Visual cue on tap (e.g., small animation or highlight)

TECHNICAL OVERVIEW:

FRONTEND:
- Grid-based layout using HTML/CSS (Bootstrap recommended for responsive design)
- JavaScript (or jQuery) event listeners for tap/click interactions
- Audio files (.mp3 or .ogg) triggered via JavaScript

BACKEND (Django):
- Object data (image path, name, audio path) managed in a JSON or database model
- Template rendering using Django context to populate page dynamically
- Language toggle passed as a session variable or URL parameter

ASSETS REQUIRED:
- High-resolution images of common objects
- Audio recordings of:
   - Object names in both English and Hindi
   - Reinforcement phrases in both languages

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Track user interactions to adaptively increase difficulty
- Add game-like elements (e.g., stars, coins for correct taps)
- Include alternate object sets (animals, fruits, vehicles, etc.)
- Support for additional regional languages

PLATFORM CONSIDERATIONS:
- Must be touchscreen-friendly (tablets, interactive boards)
- Requires speaker or headphones for auditory feedback
- Works offline with preloaded assets or online via CDN
